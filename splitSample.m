function [trainSample, testSample] = splitSample(sample, trainSize, permute)
% splits the sample into a training sample and a test sample
% trainSize is a number between 0 and 1 that decides which percentage of the sample is to be used for training
% permute is a boolean value such that if true then the sample is randomly permuted before being split, if false then no permutation is used
